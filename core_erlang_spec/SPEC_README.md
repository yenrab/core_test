# Core Erlang Specification Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive specification of the Core Erlang intermediate language used by the Erlang/OTP compiler. Core Erlang serves as a functional intermediate representation between Erlang source code and BEAM bytecode.

## Important Notice

**This specification is derived from compiler source code, not an official specification document.**

The Core Erlang language specification presented in these files was generated by analyzing the source code of the Erlang/OTP compiler. There is no official Core Erlang specification document published by the Erlang/OTP team. This documentation represents the current implementation as found in the Erlang/OTP repository's main branch as of January 2025.

## Source and Methodology

- **Source**: Erlang/OTP compiler source code
- **Repository**: https://github.com/erlang/otp
- **Branch**: main
- **Date**: January 2025
- **Method**: Analysis of compiler implementation and AST definitions

## Specification Contents

This specification includes:

1. **Grammar Specification** (`01_grammar_specification.md`) - Complete lexical and syntactic grammar
2. **AST Node Specifications** (`02_ast_node_specifications.md`) - Detailed AST node type definitions
3. **Language Semantics** (`03_language_semantics.md`) - Operational semantics and behavior
4. **Message Passing** (`04_message_passing_specification.md`) - Concurrency and message handling
5. **Index** (`00_index.md`) - Overview and navigation guide

## Purpose and Usage

This specification is intended for:

- **Compiler developers** working with Core Erlang
- **Language implementers** creating Core Erlang tools
- **Researchers** studying functional intermediate representations
- **Framework developers** building Core Erlang-based tools (like CoreTest)

## Limitations

- This specification reflects the current implementation, not a formal language definition
- Future Erlang/OTP releases may introduce changes not reflected here
- Some implementation details may vary between Erlang/OTP versions
- This documentation should be used as a reference, not as an authoritative specification

## Contributing

If you find discrepancies between this specification and the actual Erlang/OTP compiler behavior, please report them. The intent is that this specification will be updated to reflect changes in the Erlang/OTP compiler implementation.
